jStack - an opinionated stack to ship high-performance, low-cost Next.js apps.

This is an early-stage stack so probably dont use in production yet. If you're wild enough to do so despite this warning, let me know your website URL so I can feature you lol

documentation coming soon, for now just clone this repo, fill out the .env.example :))
